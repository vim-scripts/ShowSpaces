Vim-ShowSpaces is a Vim plugin which highlights the indentation characters when
spaces are used, even when spaces and tabs are mixed. It is useful to enforce
the use of tabulations in a project instead of spaces, or even worse, mixed
tabulations and spaces.

The highlighting can be activated on a per filetype basis.

READ THE DOCUMENTATION (or at least the README)! The plugin does not highlight
anything by default. You need to 'let g:showSpaces=1'  somewhere (preferably inside a
ftplugin/ local config file).
